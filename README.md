# ðŸ“˜ Online Course Registration System (C# + DLL-Based)

This is a basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project built in **C#** using **Class Libraries (DLL)** and a **Console Application**.

The project demonstrates key OOP concepts such as:

- **Inheritance**
- **Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**
- Use a **DLL (Class Library)** to organize code
